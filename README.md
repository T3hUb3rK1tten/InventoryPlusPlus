# Inventory++
## Ericsson and North Texas Food Bank Hackathon

Ericsson hosted a 24-hour hackathon for North Texas university students in November 2012. Utilizing WebRTC, we were to develop web applications that would help the NTFB be more flexible in managing its resources. We created Inventory++, a simple ERP system controlled from a responsive web application that could be used on a BYOD basis for volunteers. We utilized WebRTC to stream the camera from the device and ran a server-side QR recognition on the video stream. Our team placed third overall out of over 25 teams.

Team members: Alex Gwyn, Justin Ehlert, Nelson Leduc, Preet Dalal
